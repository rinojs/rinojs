# Rino.js 🦏

```
Fast learning, preprocessing, intuitive web framework.
```

Rino.js is created to fix the complexity matters of web framework.

## ▶️ Installation

The recommended way to start your Rino project:

```
npm create rino@latest
```

For manual setup:

```
npm i rinojs
```

## 📢 Notice
### 🎉 Release version v2.17.0
- Fixed bug that occurs when contents directory is missing

### 🎉 Release version v2.17.1
- Added staticSiteServer()

### 👍 Releasing Version 2

New version, better development experience and totally different from version 1.

Many syntax is simplified and following html, css and javascript standard. And many things are updated for automation.

Development Build System is changed to the `server side rendering` with memory data management with individual IO update on change. I call this, `build on request`. This is so much faster than version 1.

#### Example of Rino 2

- ./pages/index.html

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <component
      @path="button"
      @tag="button"
      type="button"
      onclick="alert('Hello world!')"
    />
    <component @path="footer" @tag="footer" />
    <script @type="md" style="color: red" type="text/markdown">
      ## test

      test

      - test
    </script>
    <script @type="ts" type="text/typescript">
      // This is for templating html content
      let world: string = "Hello world! from typescript";
      console.log(world);
    </script>
    <script @type="js" type="text/javascript">
      // This is for templating html content
      console.log("Hello world! from javascript");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

```

## 🕵️ Test

### E2E Test
Right now end to end testing is implemented for test backoffice website with cypresss and playright.
Both can be used to test backoffice website by:
#### Cypress:
```
npm run test-cp
```
Which is `npx cypress open`
#### Playwright
```
npm run test-pw
```
Which is `npx playwright test`

### Unit Test
I am thinking of using `jest`.
