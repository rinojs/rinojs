## 📢 Notice

### 👍 For people who use version < v1.5.2

From version v1.5.2, we updated `@event` algorithm to check `@` first so there's no need to perform unnecessary operations. And now we empty dist directory before build new version of pages. **If you have anything that is important in `/dist` from using old versions, make sure get them out of dist folder before use new version.**
