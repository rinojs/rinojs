Fast learning, preprocessing, intuitive web framework. It is "rinojs" because the name rhino, rhinojs and rino are being used by others.

```

## 📢 Notice

### 😎 For new people

Rino is ready for production. You can do static site generation and server side rendering. Build your website that services in multiple language. It is possible with default features like using markdown or [tot](https://github.com/opdev1004/totjs). Make sure you reuse the page and component template instead of creating each page for each language.

### 🤞 About documentation and official website updates

I was working on them. but I need to build rino project starter first. So I can add it to the documentation. It won't take too long.

If you are skilled and you don't mind reading stuffs for your production, then please read the code and the changes (maybe README.md) from github. Because you can use all the new features. It's not that difficult. 😉

### 👍 For people who use version < v1.3.1

From version 1.3.1, now you can start your project by:

```
npm create rino
```
