## 📢 Notice

### 👍 For people who use version < v1.5.0

From version v1.5.0, we fixed syntax of Rino.js to work with Rinokit. Rinokit is a Runtime library that use similar algorithm for building a runtime component and print data in the component. So `props` and `{{ component }}` are removed. Because props is making things verbose. And `{{ component }}` feature is moved to rinokit and it does better job.
